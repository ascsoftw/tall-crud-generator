## Requirements

Make sure that [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) is installed properly on your project.

Make sure that [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is installed properly on your project.

Make sure that [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/) is installed properly on your project.

## Installation

You can install the Package using Composer

```bash
composer require ascsoftw/tall-crud-generator
```

## Usage

After you have installed the package, you can display the Config Page by including the Livewire Component in any View.

```php
@livewire('tall-crud-generator')
```

This way you can display the Config Page using your Application Layout and can also control the Users who have access to the Page.


## Configurations

If you want to override the configurations, you can publish the View and Blade Components used using the below command
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Ascsoftw\TallCrudGenerator\TallCrudGeneratorServiceProvider" --tag=views
```

This will publish the Views in `resources/views/vendor/tall-crud-generator` directory which you can then customize. Most of the Components being used are taken from Breeze and Jetstream Packages and so should be familiar.

## FAQ
**Question:** There are many CRUD Packages available. Why use this Package?

**Answer:** Unlike other Packages, this Package works by generateing the actual Livewire Component. You are free to use it anywhere in your Project. It is also easier to customize them since you are editing the Livewire Files rather than figuring out the Configurable Options of the Package.

##
**Q:** Package doesn't support a Feaure that I need. What should I do?

**A:** The Package is at the initial stages and it only supports small number of Features. We are working on adding New Features. However, since the package generates the Actual Files, you can always Edit those Files and customize them according to your needs.
